# Leveling up your Intermine Skills with Jupyter Notebooks backed by Binder: Part II

MyBinder.org(Binder) and Github
--------------------------------

The Binder system is an impressive combination of [a great number of technologies and resourceful and helpful developers](https://bids.berkeley.edu/news/binder-20-has-arrived). Most of the technologies you don't need to know anything about to take advantage of the Binder system because it is mostly behind-the-secenes stuff the end-user should not need to engage. Think of the man and machinery behind the curtain in the Wizard of Oz. Currently, the computational infrastructure is hosted on Google Cloud Platform with funding from the Moore foundation. One of the key components of the underlying machinery is `repo2docker`. `repo2docker` is able to take a git repository and convert it into an image of a 'container', which is a lightweight, isolated virtualized system-level environemnt that starts fast. When you 'launch' a binder if the details of what to spin up, a.k.a. a built image, is already available it will make an active session based on the details specified when that image was made and let you access the active form of it from your browswer. If what is to be launched is new to the Binder system it will first build what it will need to the launch the 'system' detail in the git repository, and then proceed on to launch the active container with the active Jupyter environment set up as specified in the details of the repository. We will come back to this build step later. 

Of course, I am only touching on some of the basic details of Binder here and not any of the additional underlying tech. Power users can seek out the resources I highlight at the end of this section to delve further. Chances are good that the repository I have set up is enough to get you started if you want to use Python and Intermine. The [`requirements.txt file`](https://github.com/fomightez/intermine-binder/blob/master/requirements.txt) has some of the main popular modules and you always use `!pip install` followed by the module name in a cell within an active notebook to install additional modules. Advanced users will most likely to set up their own Binder repository to specify certain modules to already be there upon launch. For example, in the enivronment set up to run Intermine code, I have added the conversion from Python 2 to 3 that was used in the previous page (at least in early 2018) and that is beyond what is a default Jupyter set up.

Additionally, one of the important aspects Binder targets is reproducibility. Along those lines, you can lock in the versions of the software in order to better insure that everything will run as it did at the time the repository was made. Because this example repository was set up to use the most recent versions of the dependencies in order to hopefully keep it as current as possible, I didn't do that there; however, that is just one of the many other reasons advanced users may want to set up their own repositories with custom `requirements.txt` settings, or use `enviroment.yml` configuration files as illustrated [here](https://github.com/binder-examples/conda) and [here](https://github.com/binder-examples/python-conda_pip), to control the environment in the launched binder.  All you need is a Github account to customize your environment, and you can simply edit these two types of files directly in the Github web browser interface. While many users needs should be met through use of custom `requirements.txt` or `enviroment.yml` configuration files, apt-get and Docker can also be used by advanced users to specify the details of the container that ultimately will be launched. 

A `postBuild` file in the repository can be used to insure the running container does any last steps needed or retrieves data from remote sites to make your repository lightweight and more flexible. A limitation that novices may encounter is that making use of these necesitates the use of git because the file has to be executable, and I have found editing it directly in Github's browser interface seems to break this ability in a way that is not obvious as the file will still be tagged as executable in Github's browser interface. (CHECK WITH BINDER FOLKS IS THIS IS TRUE STILL?? THAT WAS A WHILE AGO.)

Every time you change your repository, the build process on Binder will need to be re-run, and so the first launch after any change to the repository can take several minutes. Typically, once built launches only take a few seconds. You can monitor the progress using the `show` toggle on the right side of the bar below the large spinning icon.
